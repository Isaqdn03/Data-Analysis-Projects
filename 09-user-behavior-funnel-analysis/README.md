# Customer Behavior Analysis & A/B Testing

## üì± Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior in a mobile application, focusing on conversion funnel optimization and A/B testing evaluation. The study examines user interactions, conversion patterns, and the statistical impact of font changes on user engagement and purchase completion rates.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The analysis aims to:
- **Analyze user behavior patterns** throughout the mobile app conversion funnel
- **Evaluate conversion rates** at each stage of the customer journey
- **Conduct rigorous A/B testing** to assess the impact of font changes on user behavior
- **Apply statistical methods** with proper corrections for multiple testing scenarios
- **Provide data-driven recommendations** for UI/UX improvements
- **Identify optimization opportunities** in the customer conversion process

## üîç Key Business Questions Answered

### User Behavior Analysis
- How do users progress through the conversion funnel?
- What are the conversion rates at each stage of the customer journey?
- Where do we lose the most users in the funnel?

### A/B Testing Evaluation
- Does changing the font significantly impact user behavior?
- Which experimental group shows better conversion performance?
- Are the observed differences statistically significant?

### Statistical Validation
- How do we account for multiple testing scenarios?
- What is the appropriate significance level after Bonferroni correction?
- Can we confidently recommend implementing the font changes?
