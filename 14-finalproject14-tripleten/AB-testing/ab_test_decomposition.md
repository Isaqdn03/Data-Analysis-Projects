# A/B Test Project Decomposition

## Project Overview
Detailed step-by-step analysis of the recommendation system A/B test for an international online store.

---

## 1. Objectives and Context Definition

### 1.1 Document Project Context
**Action**: Review and document test specifications
- Test: `recommender_system_test` (Dec 7-21, 2020 acquisition, ends Jan 1, 2021)
- Groups: A (control) vs B (new recommendation system)
- Target: 15% EU users, 6,000 participants expected
- Success criteria: 10% improvement in `product_page` → `product_cart` → `purchase` funnel

### 1.2 Formulate Hypotheses
**Action**: Define statistical framework
- H0: No difference in conversion rates between groups
- H1: Group B shows ≥10% improvement in each funnel stage
- Statistical parameters: α = 0.05, two-proportion z-tests

---

## 2. Data Loading and Inspection

### 2.1 Load and Verify Datasets
**Action**: Import libraries and load all datasets
- Load 4 CSV files: marketing events, new users, events, participants
- Use pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats
- Verify successful loading with `.info()`, `.shape`, `.head()`

### 2.2 Data Structure Analysis
**Action**: Examine dataset relationships and quality
- Map user_id relationships between tables
- Check data types and identify conversion needs
- Assess initial data quality (nulls, duplicates, outliers)

---

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preparation

### 3.1 Quality Issues Resolution
**Action**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- Treat null values and remove duplicates appropriately
- Convert date columns to datetime format
- Standardize user_id formats across tables
- Filter to test period and EU region only

### 3.2 Data Integration
**Action**: Prepare integrated dataset for analysis
- Merge participants with user demographics
- Join events with group assignments
- Create user-level conversion indicators
- Validate cross-table integrity

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

### 4.1 Group Balance Verification
**Action**: Verify randomization effectiveness
- Compare group sizes and demographic distributions
- Test balance using chi-square tests for categorical variables
- Check registration timing consistency between groups

### 4.2 Conversion Funnel Analysis
**Action**: Calculate baseline conversion metrics
- Count users at each stage: product_page, product_cart, purchase
- Calculate conversion rates for each funnel step
- Compare Group A vs Group B performance at each stage
- Create funnel visualizations

### 4.3 Temporal and Behavioral Patterns
**Action**: Analyze user behavior and external factors
- Examine daily event patterns and identify anomalies
- Check marketing events impact during test period
- Analyze user engagement levels and journey patterns

---

## 5. Statistical Testing Setup Validation

### 5.1 Test Conditions Verification
**Action**: Ensure valid A/B test conditions
- Verify adequate sample sizes for statistical power
- Check for external events that could confound results
- Validate that both groups experienced same conditions
- Document any limitations or biases

---

## 6. Statistical Hypothesis Testing

### 6.1 Conversion Rate Testing
**Action**: Perform z-tests for each funnel stage
- Create user-level conversion table with group assignments
- Execute two-proportion z-tests for each conversion metric
- Calculate p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes
- Test: product page, cart addition, and purchase conversions

### 6.2 Business Impact Analysis
**Action**: Translate statistical results to business terms
- Calculate percentage improvements vs 10% target
- Estimate revenue impact of observed improvements
- Assess practical significance beyond statistical significance
- Formulate implementation recommendation

---

## 7. Results Interpretation and Recommendations

### 7.1 Comprehensive Results Synthesis
**Action**: Consolidate findings and formulate strategy
- Summarize statistical significance across all metrics
- Compare results with original 10% improvement goal
- Provide clear go/no-go recommendation with rationale
- Define implementation approach and monitoring plan

### 7.2 Limitations and Future Considerations
**Action**: Document study constraints and next steps
- Note data limitations and external factors
- Suggest improvements for future tests
- Define success metrics for implementation monitoring

---

## 8. Final Documentation

### 8.1 Professional Deliverable Creation
**Action**: Finalize analysis documentation
- Review all calculations and ensure reproducibility
- Create executive summary with key findings
- Format visualizations and tables professionally
- Prepare comprehensive deliverables package
