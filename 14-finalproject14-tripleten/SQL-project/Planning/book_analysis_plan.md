# Book Database Analysis - Decomposition Plan

## Project Overview
**Context**: Analyze a book service database to understand market trends during COVID-19 when people shifted to home-based activities like reading, helping develop a competitive product proposition.

**Goal**: Extract insights from book, author, publisher, rating, and review data to inform business strategy for a new book-focused application.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Environment Preparation

### 1.1 Database Connection
- [x ] Establish connection to the database following provided instructions
- [x] Verify connection stability and access permissions
- [ x] Set up proper error handling for database operations

### 1.2 Initial Data Exploration
- [x] Print first few rows of each table to understand structure
- [x] Verify table relationships match the provided schema
- [x] Check data types and identify potential data quality issues
- [x] Document any discrepancies from expected schema

## Phase 2: Data Understanding & Quality Assessment

### 2.1 Table Structure Analysis
**Books Table (`books`)**
- [] Examine `book_id`, `author_id`, `title`, `num_pages`, `publication_date`, `publisher_id`
- [] Check for null values, especially in critical fields
- [] Validate date formats in `publication_date`
- [] Analyze page count distribution

**Authors Table (`authors`)**
- [] Review `author_id` and `author` fields
- [] Check for duplicate authors or missing author names
- [] Verify referential integrity with books table

**Publishers Table (`publishers`)**
- [] Examine `publisher_id` and `publisher` fields
- [] Identify major publishers in the dataset
- [] Verify referential integrity with books table

**Ratings Table (`ratings`)**
- [ ] Analyze `rating_id`, `book_id`, `username`, `rating` fields
- [ ] Check rating scale and distribution
- [ ] Identify potential duplicate ratings from same user-book combinations

**Reviews Table (`reviews`)**
- [ ] Examine `review_id`, `book_id`, `username`, `text` fields
- [ ] Assess text review lengths and quality
- [ ] Check for spam or duplicate reviews

### 2.2 Data Quality Checks
- [ ] Identify missing values across all tables
- [ ] Check for orphaned records (references to non-existent IDs)
- [ ] Validate data consistency across related tables
- [ ] Document data quality issues and proposed solutions

## Phase 3: SQL Query Development & Analysis

### 3.1 Task 1: Books Published After January 1, 2000
**Objective**: Count books released in the modern era to understand dataset scope

**SQL Development Steps**:
- [ ] Write query to filter books by publication date > 2000-01-01
- [ ] Handle potential date format issues
- [ ] Test query and validate results
- [ ] Document findings about modern vs. classic book distribution

**Expected Output**: Single count of books published after 2000

### 3.2 Task 2: Reviews and Average Ratings per Book
**Objective**: Analyze engagement metrics for each book

**SQL Development Steps**:
- [ ] Create query joining books and ratings tables
- [ ] Calculate count of ratings per book
- [ ] Calculate average rating per book
- [ ] Handle books with no ratings appropriately
- [ ] Sort results for better analysis

**Expected Output**: Table with book_id, review count, and average rating

### 3.3 Task 3: Top Publisher by Books > 50 Pages
**Objective**: Identify major publisher excluding pamphlets/short publications

**SQL Development Steps**:
- [ ] Filter books with more than 50 pages
- [ ] Group by publisher and count books
- [ ] Join with publishers table for readable names
- [ ] Identify publisher with maximum count
- [ ] Validate results make business sense

**Expected Output**: Publisher name and count of substantial books published

### 3.4 Task 4: Author with Highest Average Rating (50+ ratings)
**Objective**: Find most acclaimed author with sufficient rating volume

**SQL Development Steps**:
- [ ] Join books, authors, and ratings tables
- [ ] Group by author and calculate rating statistics
- [ ] Filter authors with at least 50 total ratings across all books
- [ ] Calculate average rating per author
- [ ] Identify top-rated author meeting criteria

**Expected Output**: Author name and average rating

### 3.5 Task 5: Average Reviews from Heavy Raters (50+ books rated)
**Objective**: Understand engagement patterns of power users

**SQL Development Steps**:
- [ ] Identify users who rated more than 50 books
- [ ] Count average number of reviews per these heavy users
- [ ] Join ratings and reviews tables by username
- [ ] Calculate meaningful statistics about power user engagement

**Expected Output**: Average number of reviews per power user

## Phase 4: Results Analysis & Documentation

### 4.1 Query Execution & Results
- [ ] Execute each SQL query systematically
- [ ] Store results using pandas for display purposes only
- [ ] Verify results are reasonable and make business sense
- [ ] Document any unexpected findings or data anomalies

### 4.2 Business Insights Development
**For Each Task**:
- [ ] Interpret numerical results in business context
- [ ] Identify implications for product development
- [ ] Connect findings to COVID-19 context and reading trends
- [ ] Suggest actionable recommendations

### 4.3 Conclusions & Recommendations
- [ ] Synthesize findings across all tasks
- [ ] Identify key market opportunities
- [ ] Recommend features for new book application
- [ ] Suggest further analysis areas

## Phase 5: Documentation & Presentation

### 5.1 Technical Documentation
- [ ] Document all SQL queries with explanations
- [ ] Include data quality observations
- [ ] Record any assumptions made during analysis
- [ ] Note limitations of the analysis

### 5.2 Business Report
- [ ] Create executive summary of key findings
- [ ] Present actionable insights for product development
- [ ] Include supporting data visualizations if needed
