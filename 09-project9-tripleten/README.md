# Business Hypothesis Prioritization & A/B Testing Analysis

## üéØ Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive business intelligence solution combining hypothesis prioritization frameworks with rigorous A/B testing analysis. The study demonstrates how to systematically evaluate business hypotheses using ICE and RICE frameworks, followed by statistical analysis of A/B test results to make data-driven decisions for business optimization.

## üìä Project Objectives

The analysis aims to:
- **Prioritize business hypotheses** using established frameworks (ICE and RICE)
- **Conduct rigorous A/B testing analysis** to evaluate conversion rates and revenue impact
- **Apply statistical significance testing** to validate experimental results
- **Provide actionable recommendations** based on statistical evidence
- **Compare different prioritization methodologies** and their business implications

## üî¨ Key Business Questions Answered

### Hypothesis Prioritization
- Which business hypotheses should be prioritized for implementation?
- How do ICE and RICE frameworks differ in their prioritization outcomes?
- What factors drive the biggest differences between prioritization methods?

### A/B Testing Analysis
- Is there a statistically significant difference in conversion rates between groups?
- How do average order values compare between test groups?
- What is the overall revenue impact of the tested changes?
- Should the test be stopped and a winner declared?

## üìà Key Findings & Results

### Hypothesis Prioritization Results

#### ICE Framework Top Priorities:
1. **Launch promotion with user discounts** - High impact/confidence, low effort
2. **Add product recommendation blocks** - Balanced high performance
3. **Add subscription forms to main pages** - Strong overall metrics

#### RICE Framework Top Priorities:
1. **Add subscription forms to main pages** - Highest reach potential
2. **Add product recommendation blocks** - Strong scalability
3. **Change category structure** - Good reach-impact combination

#### Key Insight:
- **RICE framework favors initiatives with broader reach**, even if individual impact is lower
- **ICE framework prioritizes high-impact, low-effort initiatives** regardless of scale
- The frameworks showed significant differences in ranking, highlighting the importance of choosing the right prioritization method

### A/B Testing Statistical Results

- **Group B Conversion Rate**: 3.38%
- **Relative Improvement**: 13.81%
- **Statistical Significance**: p-value = 0.0232 (significant at Œ± = 0.05)

#### Revenue Analysis:
- **Group A Total Revenue**: $53,212.00
- **Group B Total Revenue**: $79,651.20
- **Revenue Difference**: $26,439.20 (49.7% higher)

#### Order Value Analysis:
- **Group A Average Order**: $113.70
- **Group B Average Order**: $145.35 (after outlier removal: $68.24)
