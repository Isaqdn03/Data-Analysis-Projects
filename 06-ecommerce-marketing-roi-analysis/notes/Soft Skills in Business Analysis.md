# Soft Skills in Business Analysis

## 1. The Importance of Context in Data Analysis

### 1.1 Fundamentals of Business Context

The success of a data analyst is directly linked to their understanding of the business context. This includes:

- Business objectives
- Main activities
- Role of analysts
- Metrics relevant to the specific context

> **Key Concept**: Context is not just an additional detail, but rather a fundamental element that determines the validity and usefulness of any analysis.

### 1.2 Case Study: The Contextualization Error

#### Scenario

A candidate (John) in an interview for a junior analyst position answered about engagement metrics:

- **Answer given**: "It's better to analyze average session duration: the more time users spend with the app, the better!"
- **Real context**: Health monitoring app that works in the background

#### Error Analysis

- **Problem**: Generic answer without considering the specific context
- **App Reality**:
    - Works primarily in background
    - Monitors pulse and steps
    - Users check briefly (morning/night)
    - Uses push notifications

**Lesson Learned**: An apparently positive metric (longer session time) can be irrelevant or even negative depending on the product context.
